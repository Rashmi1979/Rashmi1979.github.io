I have been using SAS for a while now, however R was introduced recently to me in last few semesters. This is my first fulltime course and my views are based on what I have learned so far in this course.\

SAS is commerical software while R is opensource counterpart of SAS. Being opensource it can be downloaded by anyone. R has large community support compared to SAS, easy to find and get support on features and other capailities. So far I found SAS is more structured language while R requires more coding.\

SAS does not require prior programming language experience however R is bit tougher to learn compared to SAS. R requires basic programming knowledge.\
