I have been using SAS for a while now, however R was introduced recently to me in last few semesters. This is my first fulltime course and my views are based on what I have learned so far in this course.

What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?
SAS is commerical software while R is opensource counterpart of SAS. Being opensource it can be downloaded by anyone. R has large community support compared to SAS, easy to find and get support on features and other capailities. 

What functionality do you like about R?
The r markdown package lets you create reproducible Word documents and reproducible Powerpoint Presentations from your R markdown code just by changing one line in the YAML!

What parts do you miss about your other language?
So far I found SAS is more structured language while R requires more coding.


Do you consider R a difficult language to learn?
SAS does not require prior programming language experience however R is bit tougher to learn compared to SAS. R requires basic programming knowledge.
