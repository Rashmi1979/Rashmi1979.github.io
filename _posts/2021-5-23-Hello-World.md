**What do you think being a data scientist is about?  **

Data Scientist closely follow “the data science process “that is more approachable data ingest, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, model selection ,model evaluation and data storytelling.When a business needs to answer a question or solo problem, they turn to data scientist who gathers processes and derives valuable insights from the data.Data scientist explore all aspects of the business and develop programs using programming languages to perform robust analytics. When compared to a statistician a data scientist knows a lot more about programming however, when compared to a software engineer, then they they know much more about statistics than coding.

**What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?**
Data scientist are well equipped to store and clean large amounts of data, explore data sets to identify valuable insights, build predictive models, then run data science projects end-to-end. Data scientist gather data from multiple sources applies machine learning, predictive analysis and sentiment analysis to extract clinical information from the collected data sets. They understand data from a business point of view and can provide accurate predictions that can be used to power critical business decisions. Data scientist need knowledge in the following three departments: analytics, programming and domain knowledge. Following skills will help you carve out as a data scientist.
* Strong knowledge of python, SAS or, scala
* Hands-on experience in SQSQL database coding, 
* Ability to work with unstructured data from various sources like video and social media 
* Understand multiple analytical functions
* Knowledge of machine learning.

**What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?** 
Data scientists and statisticians gather information for similar purposes, however their means of data collection are different. Typically data science problems are formulated using a modeling process which focuses on the predictive accuracy of the model. Data scientists do this by comparing the predictive accuracy of different machine learning algorithms and selecting the model with the best accuracy. Statisticians take a different approach to building and testing their models. The starting point in statistics is usually a simple model, such as linear regression, where the data is verified to determine whether it is consistent with the assumptions of the model. The model is improved by addressing assumptions in the model that are violated. The modeling process is considered complete when all model assumptions are verified and no assumptions are violated.
While data scientists focus on comparing a number of different methods to create the best machine learning model, statisticians rather work to improve a single, simple model to best fit the data.
Statisticians tend to focus more on quantifying uncertainty than data scientists. As part of the statistical model-building process, it’s common to quantify the connection between the outcome being predicted and each predictor. Any uncertainty about this connection is also quantified. This process is not as common with the tools used by data scientists, namely machine learning.

**How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?**
As of now I view myself as a statistician. I have good understanding of data collection protocol, violations, running hypothesis tests and linear regression model. In long run I view myself as data scientist.
