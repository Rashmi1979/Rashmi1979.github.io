**What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?**

I used to think the most important thing for a data scientist is to know multiple languages like R, SAS, Python etc.
At the end of ST558 I am realising the true role of a data scientist. It is important that you should know mutiple languages that are currently used in data science but it's just a small part. Understanding the data, manupulating and cleaning it, producing graphical and numerical summaries, coming up with a model that fits the data perfectly and doing the prediction analysis all this comes under the role of a data scientist. Knowledge in the areas like statistics, machine learning and computer science is very crucial to become a good data scientist.

**What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?**

I would definately like to use R as a programming language while doing statistical data analysis. I really find functionility of R-markdown amazing. It is very easy to produce the html and pdf documents. R-shiny that was introduced in the final module of ST558 is a great way to produce your own apps and to create dynamic UIs. I find it very easy to write code for running different types regression models and models based on tree based methods in R as compared to other languages that I know such as SAS. Buit in R packages are really very useful.

**What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?**

After taking and almost finishing ST558 course I have become more confident in doing programming in R. I was stuggling in the areas of writing functions and loops before taking ST558. I no more find these areas difficult. Before, I used to do all my work in R-studio using base R packages. Now I am familiar with R markdown and a ery useful package tidyverse. I find it ery easy to use them and implement them doing statistical programs.
