**what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do**

I used to think the most important thing for a data scientist is to know multiple languages like r, sas, python etc.
At the end of ST558 I am realising the true role of a data scientist. It is important that you should know mutiple languages that are currently used in data science but it's just a small part. Understanding the data, manupulating and cleaning it, producing graphical and numerical summaries, coming up with a model that fits the data perfectly and doing the prediction analysis all this comes unde the role of a data scientist. Knowledge in the areas like statistics, mahine learning and computer science is very crucial to become a good data scientist.

**what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?**
