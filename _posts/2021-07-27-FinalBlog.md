**What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?**

I used to think the most important thing for a data scientist is to know multiple languages like R, SAS, Python etc.
At the end of ST558 I am realising the true role of a data scientist. It is important that you should know mutiple languages that are currently used in data science but it's just a small part. Understanding the data, manupulating and cleaning it, producing graphical and numerical summaries, coming up with a model that fits the data perfectly and doing the prediction analysis all this comes unde the role of a data scientist. Knowledge in the areas like statistics, machine learning and computer science is very crucial to become a good data scientist.

**What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?**

I would defiantely like to use R as a programming language while doing statistical data analysis. I really find functionility of R-markdown amzing. It is very easy to produce the html and pdf documents. R-shiny that was introduced in the final module of ST558 is a great way to produce your apps and to create dynamic UIs.I find it very easy to write code for running different types regression models and models based on tree based methods in R as compared to other languages that I know such as SAS. Buit in R packages are really very useful.
