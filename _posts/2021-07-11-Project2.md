## Project 2 - Bike Sharing Data Analysis

We analyzed Bike Sharing data in this project, by writing various functions, data table and plots. It covered almost all the topics that we learnt so far.

Next time, I would like to use Github file sharing more effectively.

Writing automated script was little difficult, selecting predictors and tune grid variables for Random Foresh were challenging items.

Rmarkdown to generate multiple output files is effective way of sepearating reports and can be done easily.
