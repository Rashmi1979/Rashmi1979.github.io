## Project 2 - Bike Sharing Data Analysis

We analyzed Bike Sharing data in this project, by writing various functions, data table and plots. It covered almost all the topics that we learnt so far.

Effective use of Github to share the code, I would do it little different next time.

Writing automated script was little difficult, selecting predictors and tune grid variables for Random Foresh was challenging.

Rmarkdown to generate multiple output files is effective way of sepearating reports and can be done easily.
